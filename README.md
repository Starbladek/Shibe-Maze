# Shibe-Maze
Absolutely ancient unfinished project from 2015 or something, where you guide a milkbone through a maze to the Shiba Inu. Made with the Slick2D library in Java, compiled in Eclipse.<br/>

I'm not sure if you need anything special to compile it. I made this as a small test project years ago, and didn't concern myself with the details of the build path or required components to run the program.
