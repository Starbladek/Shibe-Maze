# Shibe-Maze
Java game project from 2015, utilizing Slick2D, LWJGL, and the Universal Tween Engine API. In this game, you guide a milkbone through a maze in order to feed the Shiba Inu at the end.

This project is unfinished, and will probably remain that way. I do have interest in remaking it in Unity, however! This repo contains both the compiled .jar to run the game, as well as the source code. It was compiled in Eclipse.

How to use:
1. [Install Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
2. Clone this repo to some directory on your computer
3. Run "Launch.bat"
