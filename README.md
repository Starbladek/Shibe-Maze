# Shibe-Maze
Absolutely ancient unfinished project from 2015 or something, where you guide a milkbone through a maze to the Shiba Inu. Made with the Slick2D library in Java, LWJGL, and the Universal Tween Engine API. Compiled in Eclipse.<br/>

Contains both the source files as well as an executable jar file.
